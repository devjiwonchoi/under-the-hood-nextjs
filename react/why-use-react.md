# Why use React?

See [this](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations/updating-ui-with-javascript#imperative-vs-declarative-programming).

In 2024, I use React for three reasons:

1. Community
2. Alternatives exist, but no overtaker.
3. RSC - I need more study on this, but I like the concept of splitting client essential and server essential, allowing fetching on the server to reduce additional network load.
